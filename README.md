# Predicting-House-Prices-with-Regression-Models

## Overview

Accurately predicting house prices is crucial for buyers, sellers and real estate investors. Market trends, location and property characteristics all influence a home's value. This project aims to build a machine learning model that estimates house prices based on key real estate features, helping stakeholders make data-driven decisions.

## Objective 

Build and evaluate **multiple regression models (Linear Regression, Decision Trees and Random Forest)** that can estimate house prices based on **real-world housing market data**. The model should:

- Accurately **estimate prices** for new listings
- Identify the most **influential factors** affecting house prices
- Genralise well to unseen data and **minimise prediction errors**

## Challenges to Address

- **Feature importance:** Which features most impact house prices?
- **Model selection:** Which regression model provides the most accurate predictions?
- **Performance evaluation:** How well does the model generalise to unseen data?
- **Hyperparameter tuning:** How can we optimise models for better performance?

## Success Criteria

A trained model with a **low MAE, RMSE, and high RÂ² score**.
A saved model that can make predictions on **new house data**.
Insights into **which factors influence house prices the most**.
