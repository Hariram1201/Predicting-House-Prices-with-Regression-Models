# Predicting-House-Prices-with-Regression-Models

## Overview

Accurately predicting house prices is crucial for buyers, sellers and real estate investors. Market trends, location and property characteristics all influence a home's value. This project aims to build a machine learning model that estimates house prices based on key real estate features, helping stakeholders make data-driven decisions.

## Objective 

Build and evaluate ****multiple regression models (Linear Regression, Decision Trees and Random Forest)** that can estimate house prices based on **real-world housing market data**. The model should:

- Accurately **estimate prices** for new listings
- Identify the most **influential factors** affecting house prices
- Genralise well to unseen data and **minimise prediction errors**

## Dataset & Features

The dataset to be used is the [Kaggle Housing Prices Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/yasserh/housing-prices-dataset?resource=download).

**Features (X):**
- area - Area of a House
