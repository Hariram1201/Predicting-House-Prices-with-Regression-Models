createNewVar <- function(trainDataCleaned){
  "
  Creates new features from the existing cleaned dataset to potentially uncover additional patterns
  related to the sale price of the house.

  Parameters:
  -----------
  trainDataCleaned : data.frame
      The cleaned dataset used for training machine learning models.

  Returns:
  --------
  trainDataCleaned : data.frame
      The original dataset extended with newly created variables that may improve model performance.
